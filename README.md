# Sanic-Tails
A sidekick for your sanic app. 

This project (powered by Sanic) provides a boilerplate code to develop your lightening fast API complete with tests, documentation and monitoring.

## Setup Instructions
* Install python 3.6.5
* Install pip using either apt-get or brew
* Install virtualenv
* To install all the dependencies of the app run `pipenv install`. Note that you don't need to create a separate virtual environment for this project as `pipenv` handles all that.
* To run the server use `pipenv run python runserver.py`

## Running Scripts
You may want to run scripts/commands in the created virtual environment. There are two ways to do it:
* Use the prefix `pipenv run` before your command. eg. `pipenv run python`
* Activate shell using `pipenv shell`. Once activated all your commands will run in project's virtual environment. To deactivate this virtual environment run `exit`.

## Getting Started
See [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/gofynd/sanic-tails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for basic steps involved in developing an API.
